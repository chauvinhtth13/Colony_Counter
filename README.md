# Colony Counter

**Colony Counter** is a desktop application designed to assist researchers in counting bacterial or cellular colonies in images. It leverages a PyQt6-based graphical user interface (GUI) and OpenCV for image processing, with additional support from libraries like NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, Polars, and XlsxWriter for advanced data handling, optimization, and export capabilities. The application enables automated line detection, manual bounding box (bbox) editing, colony counting, and result exporting.

## Features

-   **Image Loading**: Load one or multiple images using `sys` and `os` for file handling.
-   **Line Detection**: Automatically detect colony lines with OpenCV (`opencv-python-headless`).
-   **Manual Editing**: Resize, move, or remove bboxes:
    -   Left-click and drag corners (top-left or bottom-right) to resize using `math` for coordinate calculations.
    -   Left-click and drag inside to move.
    -   Right-click inside to remove.
-   **Colony Counting**: Count colonies using `sklearn.mixture.GaussianMixture` for clustering and `sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score` for validation.
-   **Data Export**: Export results to Excel with `xlsxwriter` and manage data with `polars`.
-   **Image Navigation**: Switch between images with "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
-   **Optimization**: Utilize `pyscipopt` and `scipy` for advanced processing (assumed functionality).
